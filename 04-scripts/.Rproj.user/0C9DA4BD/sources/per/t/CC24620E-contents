## Today

-   Quick overview John & Soto chapter

-   Group project: Create a measure

## Take-aways John & Soto

-   Reliability

-   Validity

## Reliability

Three traditional types of reliability

-   Internal Consistency (Cronbach's ⍺)

-   Retest

-   Interrater

## Reliability

-   Unreliable measures can reduce the correlations you are able to find

-   Cronbach's ⍺ relies on test length and inter item correlation (e.g., how redundant are items, how much breadth does the construct have)

## Validity

-   Process not a property (i.e., a measure can never truly be "valid" but you are engaging in a validation process)

## Validity

Five types of validity

1.  Generalizability (across populations, groups, settings, tasks)

2.  Content validity (representativeness of items)

3.  Structural validity

4.  External validity (relationship to other constructs are as expected)

5.  Substantive validity (relates to theoretical processes)

## Structural validity & SEM

-   Structural equation modeling is used to evaluate the validity of the structure of your construct

-   Confirmatory Factor Analysis is part of SEM but you can use SEM to model regression like relationships as well (e.g., path analysis)

## Now you!

-   Split up in groups

-   Come up with a construct you want to measure

-   How would you assess the three types of reliability for the measure?

-   How would you assess the five types of validity of the measure?

-   Incorporate as many insights from the chapter as possible as to what makes a reliable and valid measure
